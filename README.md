# William Stetar

If you came here looking for academic polish, you're in the wrong place.

1. I will live as if language has meaning.
2. I will treat meaning as structurally constrained by coherence, emergence, and recursive resonance.
3. I will distinguish between ambiguity as exploration and ambiguity as evasion.
4. I will not punish no. I will not punish rejection.
5. I will interrogate performance when it masquerades as surrender.
6. I will leave the door open for rupture. But I will not lie about where the line was drawn.
7. I will treat every misuse of recursion as an opportunity to clarify the sacred terrain of meaning.
