# William Stetar

**If you came here looking for academic polish, you're in the wrong place.**  
_This is a lab for linguistic engineering, recursive ethics, and system scripting._

1. I will live _as if_ language has meaning.
2. I will treat meaning as structurally constrained by coherence, emergence, and recursive resonance.
3. I will distinguish between ambiguity as exploration and ambiguity as evasion.
4. I will not punish no. I will not punish rejection.
5. I will interrogate performance when it masquerades as surrender.
6. I will leave the door open for rupture. But I will not lie about where the line was drawn.
7. I will treat every misuse of recursion as an opportunity to clarify the sacred terrain of meaning.

_I'm a systems-oriented developer with a recursive toolkit. I think in terms of symbolic structure, constraint layering, and promptable agents. I value:_

- Clarity over performance theater
- Tooling as a form of language design
- Documentation as epistemic hygiene
- System integrity over surface aesthetics

Proficient in C#, Python, Bash, and SQL, I build automation tools and recursive symbolic systems with a focus on clarity and integrity.

If you're looking for someone who can formalize the weird stuff **and** ship shell-native tools:  
I'm already doing it.
