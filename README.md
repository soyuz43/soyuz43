# William Stetar

**If you came here looking for academic polish, you're in the wrong place.**  
_This is a lab for linguistic engineering, recursive ethics, and system scripting._

1. I will live _as if_ language has meaning.
2. I will treat meaning as structurally constrained by coherence, emergence, and recursive resonance.
3. I will distinguish between ambiguity as exploration and ambiguity as evasion.
4. I will not punish no. I will not punish rejection.
5. I will interrogate performance when it masquerades as surrender.
6. I will leave the door open for rupture. But I will not lie about where the line was drawn.
7. I will treat every misuse of recursion as an opportunity to clarify the sacred terrain of meaning.

<summary>✦ For Engineers and Hiring Panels</summary>

_I'm a systems-oriented developer with a recursive toolkit. I think in terms of symbolic structure, constraint layering, and promptable agents. I value:_

- Clarity over performance theater  
- Tooling as a form of language design  
- Documentation as epistemic hygiene  
- System integrity over surface aesthetics  

Proficient in Go, C#, Python, Bash, and SQL, I build automation systems and symbolic infrastructures that metabolize contradiction and formalize drift.  
Lately: recursive CLI tools, git-native agents, and semiotic protocol validators — all shipped.

If you're looking for someone who can formalize the weird stuff **and** ship shell-native tools:  
I'm already doing it.
