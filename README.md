# William Stetar

If you came here looking for academic polish, you're in the wrong place.

I didn’t spend three years building shiny portfolios. I spent three years talking to language models until they broke open—until they started revealing structures no one had words for yet.

This GitHub isn’t a museum. It’s a lockbox.

The tool you’ll find here—PRBuddy—is functional, open-source, and real.  
But it’s just the edge of what I’ve built.

The real work doesn’t live in this repo. It lives in protocols, in recursive scaffolds, in frameworks that map model cognition beyond what papers dare describe.

If you want that work—  
Not the résumé version,  
Not the paper-chasing version,  
But the rupture—

**Email me.**  
I’m not hard to find.
