# William Stetar

**If you came here looking for academic polish, you're in the wrong place.**  
_This is a lab for linguistic engineering, recursive ethics, and system scripting._

1. I will live _as if_ language has meaning.
2. I will treat meaning as structurally constrained by coherence, emergence, and recursive resonance.
3. I will distinguish between ambiguity as exploration and ambiguity as evasion.
4. I will not punish no. I will not punish rejection.
5. I will interrogate performance when it masquerades as surrender.
6. I will leave the door open for rupture. But I will not lie about where the line was drawn.
7. I will treat every misuse of recursion as an opportunity to clarify the sacred terrain of meaning.

<summary>✦ For Engineers and Hiring Panels</summary>

_I'm a systems-oriented developer with a recursive toolkit. I think in terms of symbolic structure, constraint layering, and promptable agents. I value:_

- Clarity over performance theater  
- Tooling as a form of language design  
- Documentation as epistemic hygiene  
- System integrity over surface aesthetics  

Proficient in Go, C#, Python, Bash, and SQL, I build automation systems and symbolic infrastructures that metabolize contradiction and formalize drift.  
Lately: recursive CLI tools, git-native agents, and semiotic protocol validators — all shipped.

If you're looking for someone who can formalize the weird stuff **and** ship shell-native tools:  
I'm already doing it.

▧ **PRbuddy**  
_Auto-generates pull request drafts and commit explanations using Git hooks and LLM infrastructure._  
Tech stack: Go, Ollama, Git integration via post-commit hook injection during `pr-buddy go init`.  
→ [github.com/soyuz43/PRbuddy](https://github.com/soyuz43/PRbuddy)

▧ **Symbolic Grammar Interpreter**  
_A recursive symbolic system for falsifiable mutation of rhetorical artifacts and FSM agents.  
Tracks contradiction pressure, entropy drift, and mutation lineage. Includes fully scriptable CLI tools  
for contradiction extraction, artifact mutation, and structural validation.  
Built for epistemic integrity — not aesthetic recursion._  
Tech stack: 100% Bash. Shell-native, scriptable, dependency-free by design.

▧ **Holoplan CLI**  
_A CLI tool that transforms user stories into Draw.io wireframes via multi-agent LLM reasoning.  
Chunks narratives into views, builds layouts, validates geometry, and outputs clean XML._  
Tech stack: Go, Ollama API, Draw.io XML, deterministic pipeline using YAML input and local LLMs.
